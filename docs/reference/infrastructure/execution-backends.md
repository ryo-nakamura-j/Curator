# Pipeline Execution Backends

Executors run NeMo Curator `Pipeline` workflows across your compute resources. This reference explains the available backends and how to configure them. It applies to all modalities (text, image, video, and audio).

## How it Works

Build your pipeline by adding stages, then run it with an executor:

```python
from nemo_curator.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline(name="example_pipeline", description="Curator pipeline")
pipeline.add_stage(...)

# Choose an executor below and run
results = pipeline.run(executor)
```

## Available Backends

### `XennaExecutor` (recommended)

```python
from nemo_curator.backends.xenna import XennaExecutor

executor = XennaExecutor(
    config={
        # 'streaming' (default) or 'batch'
        "execution_mode": "streaming",
        # seconds between status logs
        "logging_interval": 60,
        # continue on failures
        "ignore_failures": False,
        # CPU allocation ratio (0-1)
        "cpu_allocation_percentage": 0.95,
        # streaming autoscale interval (seconds)
        "autoscale_interval_s": 180,
    }
)

results = pipeline.run(executor)
```

- Pass options via `config`; they map to the executor’s pipeline configuration.
- For more details, refer to the official [NVIDIA Cosmos-Xenna project](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-xenna/tree/main).

### `RayDataExecutor` (experimental)

```python
from nemo_curator.backends.experimental.ray_data import RayDataExecutor

executor = RayDataExecutor()
results = pipeline.run(executor)
```

- Emits an experimental warning; the API and performance characteristics may change.

## Choosing a Backend

Both options can deliver strong performance; choose based on API fit and maturity:

- **`XennaExecutor`**: default for most workloads due to maturity and extensive real‑world usage (including video pipelines); supports streaming and batch execution with auto‑scaling.
- **`RayDataExecutor`(experimental)**: uses Ray Data API for scalable data processing; the interface is still experimental and may change.

## Minimal End-to-End example

```python
from nemo_curator.pipeline import Pipeline
from nemo_curator.backends.xenna import XennaExecutor

# Build your pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(name="curator_pipeline")
# pipeline.add_stage(stage1)
# pipeline.add_stage(stage2)

# Run with Xenna (recommended)
executor = XennaExecutor(config={"execution_mode": "streaming"})
results = pipeline.run(executor)

print(f"Completed with {len(results) if results else 0} output tasks")
```
