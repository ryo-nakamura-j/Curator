    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of NeMo Curator's `AegisClassifier`. Aegis is a family of content-safety LLMs used for detecting if a piece of text contains content that is a part of 13 critical risk categories. There are two variants, [defensive](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-LlamaGuard-Defensive-1.0) and [permissive](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-LlamaGuard-Permissive-1.0), that are useful for filtering harmful data out of your training set. Please refer to the Hugging Face pages for more information about the Aegis variants, including their output labels, here: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-LlamaGuard-Defensive-1.0 and https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Aegis-AI-Content-Safety-LlamaGuard-Permissive-1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Aegis classifiers, you must get access to Llama Guard on Hugging Face here: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b. Afterwards, you should set up a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) and pass that token into the constructor of this classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, please see this [Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/admin/installation.html#admin-installation) page for instructions on how to install NeMo Curator. Be sure to use an installation method which includes GPU dependencies."
